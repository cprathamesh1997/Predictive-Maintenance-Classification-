Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification using Synthetic Maintenance Dataset


The Predictive Maintenance Classification using Synthetic Dataset project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a machine will fail based on a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry.The dataset consists of 10,000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns.

The features include air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and machine failure labels. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. 

The project's outcome will enable researchers and practitioners to experiment with and develop predictive maintenance algorithms and models without compromising confidential and proprietary data. The project's success will be evaluated based on model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
